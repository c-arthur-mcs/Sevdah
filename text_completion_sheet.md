## Clarification
- "_in progress_" refers to the stage where there are still words which I have not gone over at all. 
- "_questions_" refers to the stage where there are words whose origins I cannot find or
whose origins I am generally unsure of. In these cases, I should be gathering enough
poems to reach out to Dr. Đurašković, around 10 per meeting should be good.
- "_completion_" refers to the stage where the poem is completed with respect to word origins,
as in all questions have been answered as of this  time.
