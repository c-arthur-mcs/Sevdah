## Clarification
- "_in progress_" refers to the stage where there are still words which I have not gone over at all. 
- "_questions_" refers to the stage where there are words whose origins I cannot find or
whose origins I am generally unsure of. In these cases, I should be gathering enough
poems to reach out to Dr. Đurašković, around 10 per meeting should be good.
- "_completion_" refers to the stage where the poem is completed with respect to word origins,
as in all questions have been answered as of this  time.

## UID Specifications:
- The UID consists of two two-character components and one three-character component. All of these are done in Latin ignoring all crowns.
  - The first two are the initials of the poet. Please refer to chart below. If unknown, these are replaced with periods.
  - The second two are the initials of the performer, if any. Please refer to chart below.If there is no performer, these are replaced with periods.
  - The third component is a number assigned to each poem. These are arbitrary, referring to the order in which I started each one\
