                <h2 class="en">Beginning of Research – Text Gathering and Standardization</h2>
                <p class="en">Of course, the first part of starting the research for any research
                    project in literature and language lies in finding the exact texts for study. In
                    consultation with librarians at the University of Pittsburgh, I found multiple
                    printed and digital resources for written texts (citations can be found on the
                    “<a href="bibliography.xhtml">bibliography</a>” page). From there, the texts were written down into an XML
                    document, which was then transformed using Regular Expressions (RegEx) in order
                    to contain every word in an &lt;origin> element, each line in a &lt;l> element,
                    and each stanza in a &lt;lg> element. For texts from sung resources, I, with
                    some help from Dr. Ljiljana Đurašković, transcribed the text by ear, and then
                    underwent the same RegEx based transformation. All of these texts are written
                    into the XML document in Bosnian Cyrillic, in order to make the XSLT
                    transformation to Latin easier. Cyrillic to Latin is always one to one or one to
                    two, but Latin to Cyrillic, being one or two to one, is more complex.</p>
                <p class="en">From there, each word was researched to find its linguistic origin,
                    and then given an attribute value (@lang=””) according to this linguistic
                    origin, as well as the general information about the text being written in a
                    &lt;meta> element before the &lt;body> which contains the text of the poem. This
                    XML document is then validated with the use of a Relax NG schema, in order to
                    standardize each XML document.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info">
                <h2 class="en">Creating the Website</h2>
                <p class="en">A major part of the digital humanities discipline lies in the use of
                    digital tools, not just to examine a text, but to make the text more accessible
                    using digital tools. This, in this case, is the usage of a website, hosted and
                    created through github. There were multiple elements of this website which make
                    the functioning more complex but make the user experience better. The first of
                    these is the use of XSLT to make each part of the text written in Cyrillic also
                    usable in Latin letters.</p>
                <p class="en">Often, the Western-European-centricity of research fields leads to
                    texts being studied and examined by English speakers, or French speakers, or
                    German speakers and then that research is presented in those languages, rather
                    than the language of the texts examined, or the language of the culture from
                    which the texts come. I want to avoid this problem by writing all of the
                    examination of the texts and the analysis bilingually. This way, someone could
                    use the entire website in Bosnian, and either in Latin or Cyrillic letters, or
                    in English.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info">
                <h2 class="en">Final Examinations</h2>
                <p class="en">The final part of the analysis in the texts is the creation of
                    statistics for each of the poems individually and also aggregate statistics, and
                    then displaying them as a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG). These transformations
                    are done through an XSLT document as a transformation scenario. These graphs are
                    the final step before writing the analysis of the data. </p>
